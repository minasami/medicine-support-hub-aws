# Healthcare Learning and Adoption

## Objective

Every stakeholder should learn the exact workflow they are allowed to perform, understand the safety boundaries, and prove readiness before receiving production access.

The learning platform uses:

- `learning_courses`
- `learning_lessons`
- `learning_enrollments`
- `learning_catalog_v1`
- public route `/learn`

Published course content is indexable and reusable by users, institutions, search engines, and AI assistants. Individual enrollment and progress remain private.

## Initial learning tracks

1. Patient healthcare journey
2. Physician connected-care workflow
3. Pharmacy clinical fulfillment
4. Laboratory and radiology workflow
5. Insurance authorization workflow
6. Institution platform onboarding
7. Clinical platform governance
8. Hospital channel and market access for field teams (`hospital-channel-market-access`)

Track 8 points at `docs/hospital-channel-toolkit/` and is intended for KAMs, medical reps, sales, and marketing.

## Design principles

- role-specific rather than generic
- workflow-based rather than feature-based
- short lessons with explicit outcomes
- bilingual English and Arabic
- accessible on mobile and desktop
- safety warnings at the point of action
- practical checklists and scenario exercises
- versioned content tied to platform releases
- private learner progress
- institutional completion reporting only with an explicit authorized relationship

## Institutional onboarding sequence

```text
Organization verification
→ operating and data-processing agreements
→ workspace configuration
→ user invitation and least-privilege roles
→ required learning tracks
→ sandbox scenarios
→ access-control validation
→ supervised pilot
→ readiness sign-off
→ controlled production access
```

## Audience outcomes

### Patients

Patients learn how to protect their account, understand care-team access, follow medicine and diagnostic workflows, read final results, monitor authorization status, and report incorrect information.

### Physicians

Physicians learn privacy-safe patient identification, encounter documentation, structured prescribing, diagnostic ordering, payer authorization, result review, and amendment rather than silent overwriting.

### Pharmacies

Pharmacy teams learn to receive routed orders, verify medicine and quantity, preserve the prescriber's intent, document partial or complete fulfillment, and maintain audit evidence.

### Laboratories and radiology centers

Diagnostic providers learn to accept assigned orders, understand the clinical question and priority, schedule and perform services, issue preliminary or final results, and correct reports through attributable amendments.

### Payers

Payer reviewers learn to verify coverage, review linked evidence, request missing information, record amounts and expiry, and issue attributable human-reviewed decisions.

### Institution administrators

Administrators learn organization verification, role assignment, consent procedures, training assignment, workflow testing, incident escalation, downtime procedures, and launch approval.

### Platform administrators

Platform administrators learn identity and access auditing, tenant isolation, terminology and interoperability governance, security review, backup and restoration, and production release gates.

### KAMs, medical reps, sales, and marketing

Field teams learn hospital-channel trends in Egypt, formulary and P&T drivers, market-access language, account planning, and how to contribute field intelligence with provenance. Course completion is platform onboarding only. It is not a sales licence or proof of medical competence.

## Completion meaning

Course completion confirms Medicine Support Hub onboarding only. It is not:

- a medical license
- a pharmacy license
- a laboratory accreditation
- an insurance credential
- a regulatory certification
- proof of professional competence outside the platform

## Content governance

Each operational or clinical course should have:

- named content owner
- named subject-matter reviewer
- version and review date
- linked platform release
- learning outcomes
- limitations and escalation routes
- retirement or replacement process

## SEO, GEO, and AI discoverability

Public learning content uses:

- canonical `/learn` route
- stable course slugs and anchor links
- descriptive headings and summaries
- audience, level, duration, outcomes, language, and version
- `Course` and `ItemList` structured data
- sitemap inclusion
- `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` summaries

Patient identities, clinical records, individual progress, assessment results, and institution-private assignments must never appear in public structured data, sitemaps, or AI context files.

## Adoption metrics

Privacy-safe operational metrics may include:

- enrollment by role and institution
- completion percentage
- median completion time
- overdue required training
- workflow error rate before and after training
- support requests by lesson topic
- failed sandbox scenarios
- release-version re-certification status

Identifiable learner performance must not be published without a valid institutional and privacy basis.
